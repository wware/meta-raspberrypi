-what is it?
-===========
-
-Ida is a small and fast image viewer, motif-based.  For people who
-don't want the KDE/GNOME overhead.  Some basic editing functions are

-=====
-
-Check the INSTALL file for detailed build instructions.
-
-ida uses Motif 2.x features (utm, render tables).  This means you need
-openmotif, lesstif does *not* cut it.
-
-It also uses the usual graphics libraries (libtiff, libpng, libjpeg,
-...), you should have them installed to get support for these image
-formats.

-what "ida" stands for?
-======================
-
-It is just a name.  The utility used to be named "iv" for "Image
-Viewer", but that gave lots of name clashes.  Its very likely that
-people name such a tool "iv", it is also used as shortcut for
-InterViews (remember Sun's Open Windows?).  So i decided to rename it.
-
-I looked for a short name starting with 'i' in a list for children
-first names.  I like "ida", so I picked this one.  It is a old, german
-name.

+Using fbi for 3d printing
+=========================
+
+This will involve a Raspberry Pi board directly driving a DLP pico projector to
+expose UV-curable resin.  Most of the time you want a black screen.  Then you
+expose areas of white for a fixed number of seconds, and you go back to black.
+
+Do not use `apt-get install` to install `fbi` on your RPi.  Use this version
+because it will have a special tweak.  The tweak is the addition of a "-S"
+command line option which suppresses the status line.  Build it like this.
+
+```bash
+sudo apt-get install libexif-dev libjpeg8-dev libfontconfig1-dev
+sudo ln -s /usr/include/freetype2/freetype /usr/include/freetype
+make
+sudo make install
+```
+
+A few notes on performance.  If you have a relatively small PNG file, then the
+image comes up nearly immediately.  I think small PNGs are the way to get a
+reliable UV exposure time.  If I start designing 3D parts so intricate that
+the PNGs get large, I'll need to rethink that strategy.
+
+These are the kinds of commands that appear to work for this.
+
+```bash
+#!/bin/bash
+sudo ./fbi -S -1 -T 1 -d /dev/fb0 kitten.png
+sleep 5
+sudo ./fbi -S -1 -T 1 -d /dev/fb0 black.png
+sudo killall fbi         # because it leaves processes lying around
+```
+
+It might be a good idea to adjust the argument of the `sleep` command based on
+the size and/or complexity of the PNG file.  Probably just the size: because
+PNG is a compression scheme, size and complexity are probably closely related
+in some Kolomogorv-ish way.  I expect that my early stuff will not be so
+complex, so that can wait for later.
+
+*WE NOW RETURN YOU TO YOUR REGULARLY SCHEDULED README*
